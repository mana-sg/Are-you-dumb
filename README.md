# Are you dumb? Just remember it

This app uses firebase cloud storage to store the to-do list items of individual users.
The users can create multiple accounts and authenticate themselves to acess the previously saved to-do list items

This app has a mean persona to get your things done and hence the name.

This app also uses the UserNotifications module from swift to send the users notifications an hour before the to-do due date.
The app automatically schedules the notification if the user opts for notifications during creating the to-do item.
